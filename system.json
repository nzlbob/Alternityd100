  "license": "This isn't licenced, Lots of other peoples work was used in the creation of this VTT implemntation. A LOT of Starfinder is used, because for some reason Many features from Alternity (the Original) are used in Starfinder so it was easy to port across. Barbrawl was used as a basis for the token bars, I think I sole some code for token movement as well. All in all Alternity stands apon the shoulders of GIANTS!"
